# Transaction Management Ideas:
    - Selecting a category and choosing all the transactions that belong to that category
    - Having the neural network group transactions by what it thinks belong together and you can yay or nay them in batches

# Connecting Python to a database:
    - Create a new user in pgAdmin
    - Add an entry to the pg_hba.conf file:
    TYPE    DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS       METHOD
    host    budget_boys     your_username   IP Address    md5
